        <p>Hi Everyone! My name is Loni Leetham. I love being creative - drawing, painting, and making things out of
            wood. I am a part-time professional photographer and full-time preschool teacher. I love being outside,
            camping, hiking, walking, kayaking, tubing, traveling, really anything that allows me to enjoy God's
            creations. I am Majoring in Professional Studies with certificates in Graphic Design, Web Design and
            Programming, and Software Development. I have been married for 20 years and 3 amazing children aged 17, 14,
            and 12. We live in Spanish Fork, Utah USA.</p>

        <p>The landscape of Utah is amazing to behold. I have had the fortunate opportunity to grow up in Utah. From
            Utah's southern desert red rock, all the way to it's northern white salt flats, each part is unique and
            extrodinary.
