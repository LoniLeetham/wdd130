        <p>Hi Everyone! My name is Loni Leetham. I love being creative - drawing, painting, and making things out of
            wood. I am a part-time professional photographer and full-time preschool teacher. I love being outside,
            camping, hiking, walking, kayaking, tubing, traveling, really anything that allows me to enjoy God's
            creations. I am Majoring in Professional Studies with certificates in Graphic Design, Web Design and
            Programming, and Software Development. I have been married for 20 years and 3 amazing children aged 17, 14,
            and 12. We live in Spanish Fork, Utah USA.</p>

        <img src="images/utah.jpg" alt="Utah landscape">
        <p>Utah is a state in the western United States. It is bordered by Colorado to the east, Wyoming to the
            northeast, Idaho to the north, Arizona to the south, and Nevada to the west. It also touches a corner of New
            Mexico in the southeast. The state is a center of transportation, education, information technology, and
            research, and a major tourist destination for outdoor recreation. Salt Lake City, the state capital and
            largest city, is home to the headquarters of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).
